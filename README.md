The company struggled to make accurate data-driven decisions. It lacked data transparency due to its reliance on Excel for all data analytical operations even after expanding its operations to multiple countries.

These dashboards empower businesses to track performance across all departments in detail over specific time periods, enabling the swift identification and resolution of issues within specific regions, countries, or products. By adopting this proactive, data-driven approach, organizations can address operational challenges promptly, ensuring alignment with strategic goals and driving more informed decision-making.
